# Excel-VBA-Projects

Hi there!

This serves as a portfolio for my personal projects developed using **Microsoft Excel** and **Excel VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)**. Each project is designed to solve a specific problem: to automate a task, or to provide a useful tool for data analysis and manipulation within the Excel environment.

> üì¶ Note: The **Centralized Data Organizer** and **Real-Time Currency Converter** have been moved to their own dedicated repository for better versioning and documentation.  
> üëâ Project titles are hyperlinked to each repo.
